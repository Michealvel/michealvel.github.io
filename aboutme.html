            <p>My name is Peter Baah, and currently I work as Health Information Management Specialist.</p>
<p>I aspire to be a web developer and a social entrepreneur, I was always fascinated with the idea of how businessess can be used to solve
problems and to provide opportunities for others.</p><p>I realized that, if businessess are ethically grounded it would do
wonders for the world and is also key to lasting success. I joined the United States Army right after <time datetime="2001-09-11">September 11, 2001.</time><br>
 it was an experience that I would never forget and I will ever cherish. I participated in a rescue mission dubbed
Black Sunday, in which most of my comrades were wounded and some killed in action.</p> As a purple heart veteran, I connect
easily with veterans and anyone as well.<br> Lately, I have become curious with programming. I love to see the idea of what
I had just created. I decided to start with web design. Through research , I came across <strong>Vetswhocode</strong> and decided to
apply for the program.</p>
