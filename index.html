<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<img src="vel.jpg" alt="picture of me" width="200" height="200">
<p>My name is Peter Baah. I currently work as Health Information Management Specialist at the Department of Veteran Affairs. I got my B.S. in Health Information Management Technology at Post Long Island University. </p><p>I aspire to be a social entrepreneur, I was always fascinated with the idea of how businessess can be used to solve problems and to provide opportunities for others. I realized that, if businessess are ethically grounded it would do wonders for the world and is also key to lasting success. I joined the United States Army right after, September 11th, 2001, it was an experience that I would never forget and I will ever cherish. I participated in a  rescue mission dubbed Black Sunday, in which most of my comrades were wounded and some killed in action. As a purple heart veteran, I connect easily with veterans and anyone as well. Lately, I have become curious with programming. I love to see the idea of what I had just created. I decided to start with web design. Through research , I came across <em><b>Vetswhocode</b></em> and decided to apply for the program.</p>
